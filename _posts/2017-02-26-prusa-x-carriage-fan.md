I have a Prusa i2 3D printer, and I love tweaking it and replacing its parts with my custom ones.

On my printer is mounted the original Prusa x carriage, the one designed by GregFrost, but I noticed that the build surface width was reduced, because the fan was positioned parallel to the x axis.

So I tried to put the fan mount on the other side, remixing [Jonaskuehling](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18657)'s version and adding [Greg](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9869)'s fan mount to the side parallel to the y axis, so that it doesn't take up important space to the build surface.

The source (openSCAD) and .stl files are available on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2138398) for download.

Happy printing!
